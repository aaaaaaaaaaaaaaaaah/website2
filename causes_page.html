                form of sun protection, UV light could cause severe and irreversible damage. It penetrates deep to a point where it can change the person's DNA. 
                Since this is at a cellular level, the damage will not present instantly. It takes some time for physical symptoms to appear, and 
                by then it cannot be reversed.

                  <strong>UVA penetrates through all layers of the skin.</strong> 
                  UVA Light is a form of UV radiation. Its longer wavelength is what allows it to penetrate through all layers of the skin.
                  Repeated UVA exposure causes the skin to age faster.
                  UVA exposure is commonly associated with tans and sunburns in certain individuals. 
                  Thus, there is no such thing as a safe tan.
                  UVA Light affects the collagen, which provides the structure, strength and support to one's skin. Cappilaries which are a 
                  type of vessels are also damaged by these rays, and they are needed to transport oxygen and nutrients throughout the body.
                  Finally, elastin fibres are damaged, which is responsible for maintaining the skin's elasticity. Overall, the DNA of a person 
                  can be altered. Since the UVA radiation hits the skin, it changes the DNA which causes mutation and defects. This could create
                  cancerous cells, and are therefore dangerous.
                  In sunscreen, broad-spectrum protection is what they use to associate UVA radiation, and to protect you from it.

                  <strong>UVB only penetrates the outermost layer of the skin, but may cause more damage. </strong>UVB light, known for its shorter wavelength, 
                  is primarily responsible for irritating the outer layer of the skin. Its high energy level  leads to the formation of precancerous 
                  cells and is commonly associated with skin burning. Due to its significant impact on skin health, UVB protection is a critical component in 
                  sunscreens, indicated by the Sun Protection Factor (SPF). The SPF number provides a guideline for how long it would take for the sun's radiation 
                  to redden your skin with the product applied, compared to without it. UVB radiation poses a threat to skin health, with its effects 
                  being most powerful from mid-morning until mid-afternoon. Its intensity increases at higher altitudes and when reflected off surfaces like snow 
                  or ice. However, UVB rays can be filtered and do not penetrate glass, offering some protection when indoors.
